## Business Requirements

### Business Requirement 1: Discover Patient Readmission Patterns

**Objectives:**

* Describe readmission patterns using other variables
* Present plots/tables
*

**Benefit to user(s):**

* understand data/patterns better
* Hospital/health care managers

### Business Requirement 2: Predict Readmission

**Objectives:**

* Predict if a patient will be readmitted

**Benefit to user(s):**

* planning for hospital beds
* medications and health service management
*

ML Task: Classification

### Business Requirement 2: Predict Duration to Readmission

**Objectives:**

* Predict expected duration before readmission

**Benefit to user(s):**

* planning for hospital beds
* medications and health service management

ML Task: Regression/Classification

## ML Business Case

### Predict Readmission

#### Classification Model

* Predict if a patient with given metrics will be readmitted.

### Predict Duration Before Readmission

#### Classification/Regression Model

* Predict time duration before a patient is readmitted.

### Cluster Analysis

#### Classification/Regression Model

* Create an ML model to cluster similar patient behaviour/attributes.
